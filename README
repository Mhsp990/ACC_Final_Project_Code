# Adaptative Cruise Control Code

In this repository, we developed the code for our ACC based on the Matlab model and requirements at ACC_Code/ACC/Code.c.
Was also developed some test suites to verify the code operation.
For all compilations to work correctly, the compilation environment must be Linux.

## üöÄ First of all, clone this repository to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/Mhsp990/ACC_Final_Project_Code.git
```

### üìã Prerequisites

-> GCC compiler
-> CUnit unit tester
-> GCOV test coverage
-> GCOVR coverage report

GCC needs to be installed on your local machine previously and than you can use the 
makefile to install all the necessary freeworks to run Test, coverage and report.

### üîß Makefile Instructions 

Open linux terminal, enter the <ACC_Code> folder and run the lines code below in order.

* Comand to install CUnit tester

```
make install cunit
```

* Comand to build the tests from Test_ACC.c

```
make build
```

* Run the main file

```
./main
```

And then the tests were generated and executed creating the .gcno, .o and .gcda binaries.
Next we will run the following commands to make coverage and report.

* Comand to build the coverage tests

```
make coverage
```

* Comand to install gcovr and libraries - needs the pip package management

```
make deps
```

* Comand that generate html file at gcovr-report folder

```
make gcovr-report
```

### üî© Analyze tests end-to-end

After compiled all comands above, we have the following results:
